# Julia + Tiramisu
polyhedrally optimizing some PDEs would be cool

# Adversarial attacks / Pruning -> Interpretability on PDE NNs
pruning: operational results, may reduce very small networks even more, to the point of analytical analysis (?)

adv attacks: interesting, BUT: "small changes in input should not induce large changes in output" might not hold in the ODE / PDE setting; may need to come up with other benchmarks
    RE: features not bugs, just another way to impose priors on networks

interpretability: woo woo
    UIs for manipulating networks
    dissecting networks
    saliency???
    analytical analysis??????
    human studies??????????????

# Voronoi maps / world generation
could be neat, not sure where it would be publishable
sparse: might tie into tiramisu

# TODOs
find partners?
